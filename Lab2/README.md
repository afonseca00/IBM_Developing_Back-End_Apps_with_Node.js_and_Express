# Lab 2: Promise Callback

This project demonstrates how to use Promises in Node.js for managing asynchronous operations. You'll learn how to handle single and multiple Promises, and explore how their execution order works.

## Objectives

- Understand and describe Promise callbacks.
- Create and execute a Node.js application with Promises.
- Manage multiple Promises, including sequential execution.

## Steps

1. Create a script with a Promise that resolves after a delay and logs messages before and after the Promise call.
2. Experiment with two Promises resolving at different intervals:
   - Call the second Promise only after the first one resolves.
   - Modify the script to execute the Promises sequentially.
3. Analyze the execution order of console logs in the provided examples.

## Summary

By completing this lab, you will:

- Gain hands-on experience with Promises in Node.js.
- Learn to manage asynchronous operations using callbacks and sequential execution.
- Understand how Promises help structure asynchronous JavaScript code.
